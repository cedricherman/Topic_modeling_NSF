# Topic_modeling_NSF

Fundamental research enables breakthrough in science and technology which in turns benefits all of us in our daily life. Research is expensive and thus funding is critical for any team of individuals wanting to give birth to their blooming ideas. Thanks to the National Science Foundation (NSF), a US federal agency, people can apply for research grants in any science and engineering fields except for medical sciences. Each award is documented and available on the NSF website per year tracing back to 1959. This project is based on the past 50 years period from 2017. Each year has its own zipped folder which contains about 10,000 xml file, one per award. Data size is about 1.5GB but it has ~400k award! (xml files).

The challenge is to determine whether we can classify research topic accurately based on abstracts and other information so that we can point out what science was the most supported over the years.
